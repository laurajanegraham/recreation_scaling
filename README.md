Continent-wide scale dependencies in the relationship between a cultural ecosystem service and social-ecological covariates
===

Scale dependencies in the relationship between recreation and social-ecological covariates. We have three different data sources at different extents: 

- Regional (Wessex BESS data)
- Country (Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment, England)
- Continent (Flickr photos, Europe)

We will look at how the relationship with socio-economic and environmental variables changes by: 

1. Data source
2. Study extent
3. Study resolution
